***It's a small attempt to utilize the technology for the sake of humanity by predicting the figures roughly so that we can do the needful to counter the situation.***

***You can predict for any number of days and view predictions for any country that you selected from the given list.***

****Time series data captures a series of data points recorded at (usually) regular intervals. Some common examples include daily weather temperature, stock prices, and the number of sales a company makes.****

****Many classical methods (e.g. ARIMA) try to deal with Time Series data with varying success (not to say they are bad at it). In the last couple of years, [Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) models have become a very useful method when dealing with those types of data.****

***Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTMs are one type of those) are very good at processing sequences of data. They can "recall" patterns in the data that are very far into the past (or future). In this tutorial, you're going to learn how to use LSTMs to predict future Coronavirus cases based on real-world data.***

**COVID-19**

**The COVID-19 is affecting 210 countries and territories around the world and 2 international conveyances.**

**3.4% Mortality Rate estimate by the World Health Organization (WHO) as of March 3
In his opening remarks at the March 3 media briefing on Covid-19, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated:**

**“Globally, about 3.4% of reported COVID-19 cases have died. By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1% of those infected.”**

**The novel coronavirus' case fatality rate was estimated at around 2%, in the WHO press conference held on January 29, 2020**

**Since, COVID-19 is a Global Outbreak, We have to fight this Pandemic by supporting Government and Maintaining the Social Distancing Norms and following all the precautionary measures for maintaining healty life style.**

***STAY HOME AND STAY SAFE***
